//This method finds the size of the file, it's input is char pointer
//named dir, i used dirent.h library. I create a DIR type pointer named dp and a pointer object
//named ent. Then i opened the directory and count the files in it. Because of 
// readdir function's first two line is .. and . in order to prevent that i added an if block on line 16.

//If it is found it says it is found and prints it's location.
